There are some python codes due to simulate the evolution and the satellites formation process by using Lagrangian forms.
Still an incompleted program

main: main codes 
	core.py: 
	  the core of the program, which describes the disk\particles and system object

	disk_properties: 
	  some functions can be used to calculate the properties of the gas in disk

	ode.py: 
	  to solve ODE

	planets_properties.py:
	  get the evolution properties of planets

	functions.py:
	  some functions often used
	  
	userfun.py:
	  some functions needed by user, like figuring some plots and store the data to a csv file

Test: test by users
	test.py: 
 	  use the above file to run a evolution
