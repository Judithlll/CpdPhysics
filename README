There are some python codes due to simulate the evolution and the satellites formation process by using Lagrangian forms.
Still an incompleted program

core.py: 
  the core of the program, which describes the disk\particles and system object

disk_properties: 
  some functions can be used to calculate the properties of the gas in disk

ode.py: 
  to solve ODE

planets_properties.py:
  get the evolution properties of planets

functions.py:
  some functions often used
  
userfun.py:
  some functions needed by user, like figuring some plots and store the data to a csv file

test.py: 
  use the above file to run a evolution
